ls 
mkdir project //This creates a new folder 
cd project //For navigating up folder 
use cd .. for navigating down 
git init //This will initialize the current folder as a git repository. This history of the current folder can now be maintained. 
ls  //This is the list command. It displays the list of all the files and folders in the current directory
ls -a //This command displays all the hidden files. you can also use ls -hidden if error for ambiguity occurs
ls .git //To view what is inside the .git file: 
touch names.txt //Command for creation of a new file 
git status //This is the command which tells us about the status of current changes 
Untracked ka matlab ki agar repo ko share kiya jaye to ye changes samne vale ko nahi dikhenge. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
git add . //this will add all the files in the current directory(all the untracked files) OR use git add names.txt for adding specific files. Here, if we use the "." in the add command, it will stage all the untracked changes
(color of untracked files changes from red to green at git status)
git commit -m "This is my first commit" // -m stands for the message 

When you make changes to a file in your working directory, Git does not track those changes until you stage them. You can use the git add command to stage one or more files. Once you have staged the files, you can commit them to the project history using the git commit command.

//For writing anything into a file
mkdir <NAME OF FOLDER> //Creating a folder
touch <filename with extension> //Creating a file
vi <filename with extension> // Entering or opening the file
Perform the entries
Press esc
Then type :x or :wq//It will save and exit OR
Type :w // This will save and not exit
For renaming type :w [name of the file without extension]
To exit without saving, type :q!
For viewing whats in the file type cat <filename with extension>

#Learning Github

For adding /attaching a github repo 
git remote add origin <link of github repo>
git remote -v
git push origin master

touch surnames.txt
touch hotel.txt
git add .
git commit -m "hotel.txt added"
touch roll no.txt
git add .
git commit -m "roll no.txt added" 
//Performing some random commtis

ls .

// head is just the pointer
/* below is only for explanation
git branch feature - this is for creating a new branch
git checkout feature //this means that head now points to feature branch 
git checkout main //head now points to main branch
git merge feature - this will merge the feature branch with main branch
*/
git log
git remote -v // CTRL+clickonlink to open on github
git push origin master //For pushing the code to master branch
================================================================
Working with projects
A project which is in someone else's account, we can't make changes directly to it.
For doing so we first have to fork it. doing so will create a copy of that project to our github account now for working on the project we clone it to our system by using 
git clone <link of github code>
//Note: Origin url is our own account
//Note: From where we have forked is upstream url
git remote add upstream <link of github code>

Navigate to the directory 
create a file and make some changes
for commiting create a new branch
git branch aryan
git checkout aryan
git add .
git commit -m "committing to aryan branch"
git log
git push origin aryan

git checkout main

//Following are the command lines to sync your fork with the repo from where you forked it
git fetch --all --prune
git reset --hard upstream master
git log
git push origin main
------------------------------------------
git pull upstream main // this will pull any changes performed in the original repo
=========================================
merging/squashing all the branches into one single branch
create multiple branches and do some basic commits
git rebase -i <link of commit from git log>
squash others and pick the first
git reset --hard // this will uncommited files (unconfirmed)
